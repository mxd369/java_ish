The benefit of the Monte Carlo method is it allows you to
perform this calculation with very high numbers of trials
by using the computer simulator.


Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Approximating the value of a function
  - Using random sampling to make a "best guess"
  
Pattern
  1. Define a domain of possible inputs.
  2. Generate random inputs over the domain.
  3. Perform a deterministic computation on the inputs.
  4. Aggregate the results.

Approximate PI
  - Consider a square and a circle.
  - Ratio of circle area to square area is PI/4
  - Place circle inside square
  - Select many random points
  - Divide points in the circle by points in the square
