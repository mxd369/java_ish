This is an example of a simulation that can be coded in Java
to help determine the appropriate size for building a garage
based on the expected number of customers at various times of the day.


Parking Garage Simulation Example:

  Simulate the entries and departures of cars

  Track the loss of customers who can't enter when full

  Two model classes:
    Car
    Garage

  Three other classes: 
    Event,
    Schedule,
    Monitor(data accumulator)

==========
Schedule Class    //will manage the events, monitor
  Keeps a queue (list) of events
  Ordered By Event Time
  Drives the overall simulation
  Continues while there are events in the queue
==========
Car Class
  Contains the inter-arrival and length of stay
  Upon Arrival it notifies the Monitor
  Posts the arrival Event to the schedule
  Checks if the garage is full; if not, it notifies the garage
  Determines length of stay and posts departure event
===========
Garage Class
  Tracks cars currently inside
  Provides Status-full or not
  Decreases available capacity if not already full
===========
Monitor Class
  Tracks Statistics
  Number of customers
  Number of lost customers
  Average length of stay
  Revenue





Sample Run
  Start simulation by putting events in the schedule
  Events are arrival of first car and the end of simulation
  Repeat the basic simulation loop
  Ask the Garage to report its current occupants
  Ask the Monitor for overall stats for the session
