Checking Account:
  Balanace
    Private
    Updated using method
  Withdraw
    Checks balance
    Applies withdrawal fee

Concrete example(of encapsulation):
So let's think about a checking account.
Inside a checking account you have a balance.
It's declared as private so it can only be updated using a method.
One of the operations that you can perform on your
balance is you can withdraw money.
The withdraw method checks to make sure the balance is greater
than the withdrawal amount prior to reducing the balance.
This provides a way to make sure the customer cannot get overdrawn
by withdrawing more money than what is in the account.
Some banks might also charge a withdrawal fee.
That logic could be included in the method as well.
