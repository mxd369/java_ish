/*

- Let's look at our first challenge.
In this challenge you should use a text editor to write a Java program.
I use brackets but Notepad++ or even Notepad would work just fine.
The program should take in a string prompt as an argument.
Then it's going to print that back to the screen.
The prompt message should ask the user to enter their name and their age.
Use the Scanner class to read in the name as a string and the age as an integer.
Using this information, display the information back to the console.

Once your program is written make sure to save the program
to your myJava folder on the C: drive.
Don't forget to set your environment variables before trying to compile the .java file.
Go ahead and compile it using the command line. javac, space, your program name, .java.
And finally you can run it using the java command. Run the program from the command line.
Don't forget to include your message after the program name.
I'm estimating that this will take you about 10 minutes to do.

So go ahead and give it a try. Good luck and have fun.
