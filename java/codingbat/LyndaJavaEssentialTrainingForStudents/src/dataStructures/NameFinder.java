/*
- It's time for another challenge.
In this challenge,
I would like you to write a complete Java program that includes a
separate method used to find a specific name in a two-dimensional table.
We'll call this the name search game. In the exercise folder you will
find the start of a program, including a main method that contains a
2D array of names. Your job is to write the method that takes two parameters,
a two-dimensional array of strings called name table and a string called name to find.

The method returns a Boolean value of true or false.
Your method should search the two-dimensional array of names to check for
a match with name to find. Your program will ask the user to guess a name.
You'll use the method to search the array and print out a message if the name was found.
Make sure you allow the user to play the game more than once.
But before you actually turn this over to someone,
make sure you test it using a valid value that is found and a value that's not found.

I've estimated about 15 minutes for this activity. Have fun with the name game.


Objectives:
  create the name search game
  Start with a 2D array of names
