Modify the RationalNumber class from Chapter so that it implements the Comparable interface.
To perform the comparison, compute an equivalent floating point value from the numerator
and denominator for both RationalNumber objects, and then compare them using a tolerance
value of 0.0001. Write a main driver to test your modifications.

Step1:
Program Plan:
  -Define RationalNumber class by implementing comparable interface.
  -CompareTo method calculates the rational fraction value and 
  compares with tolerance
  -Instantiating objects of class RationalNumber and then testing all the
  methods defined

Modify the Task class from Programming Project 9.6 so that is also implements
the Comparable interface from the Java Standard class library. Implements
the interface such that the tasks are ranked by priority. Create a driver class
whose main method shows these new features of Task objects.

"Programming Project 1"

Design a Java interface called Priority that includes two methods: setPriority and getPriority.
The interface should define a way to establish numeric priority among a set of objects.
Design and implement a class called Task that represents a task (such as on a to-do list)
that implements the Priority interface. Create a driver class to exercise some Task objects.

Program Plan:

  -Defining interface Priority.
  -Define class Task which implements Priority interface and defines methods of its class
  as well as Priority interface.
  -Task implements comparable interface, method compareTo compares two task objects.
  -TaskDriver tests the Task class methods using objects.
