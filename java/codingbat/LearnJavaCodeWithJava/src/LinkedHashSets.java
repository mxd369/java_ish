// LinkedHashSet
// HashSet does not auto retain order of elements as they're added
// LinkedHashSet: to order elements, maintains a linked list of the set's elements
// in the order in which they were inserted
//
// What is hashing?
// A hash table stores information through a mechanism
// called hashing
// in which a key's informational content is used to determine
// a unique value called a hash code
// basically each element in the HashSet is associated with its unique hash code
//
// Collection types: Lists, Maps, Sets
// choice for which to use is specific to data to store and manipulate
//

// Sets contain unique values only
// HashSet does not retain order
