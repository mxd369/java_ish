/*

- Welcome to the last challenge for this series.
In this challenge, you're going to want to create a graphical user interface.
You'll use NetBeans GUI Interface builder, and you'll add components to a frame.
For this challenge, I'd like you to create a frame that has two panels.
In the first panel, you'll add a label for first name and a text field,
a label for last name, and a second text field.
In the second panel, you're going to name this panel languages.
Inside this panel we're going to add check boxes.

You can add as many as you'd like, but let's add some for some of the most
common programming languages, such as Java, C, PHP, C++, HTML, Python,
and if you have a favorite, go ahead and add that too.
Finally, at the bottom of your frame add an exit button that will allow the user to exit.
This is similar to the activity we did in this section, so if you have trouble,
look at that first. I'm estimating this will take about 10 minutes.
As always, try to have fun.
