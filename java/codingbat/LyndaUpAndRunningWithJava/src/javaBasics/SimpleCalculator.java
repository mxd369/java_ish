- This challenge is designed to give you an opportunity to use the skills
that you learned in this section. You'll be given an algorithm that describes
the steps for calculating the surface area of a house, to determine the amount
of paint needed.
You are only required to calculate the total surface area of the exterior of the house,
but you can extend this challenge by also calculating the gallons needed by
asking the user for the amount of coverage area of one gallon of paint.
One hint is that don't forget that a house has a front and a back and two sides.

The challenge objectives for this activity is to write a complete Java program,
translate algorithm steps into Java, use appropriate data types for variables,
prompt the user for information, and print the results.
Okay, now let's go over the algorithm.
These are the steps needed to paint the exterior of a house.
Declare all variables. Ask the user for the house length, the width and the height.
Ask for the number and size of the windows.

Ask for the number and size of the doors,
because windows and doors do not need to be painted.
Finally, calculate the total surface area that will be painted.
Okay, that's your challenge. I'm estimating 20 minutes for this activity,
but it might take a little longer if you're new to this process.
Have fun.
