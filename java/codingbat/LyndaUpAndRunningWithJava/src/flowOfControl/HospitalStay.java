- Okay, it's time again for our challenge.
The challenge objectives for this section are to add decision-making logic
and use a loop to allow the program to continue multiple times.
You want to write a program that computes and displays the total charges for
our patient in a hospital stay. The patient might be admitted overnight.
For an overnight stay, you're going to ask the user for the hospital overnight charges,
as well as medication charges and lab service charges.

If it's not an overnight stay,
then you're just going to have medication charges and lab service charges.
You're going to calculate the charges, print the final total,
then ask the user if they want to calculate the charges for another patient.
I've estimated 20 minutes for this activity,
but it might take you a little longer,
or you might get it done a little sooner,
but either way, have fun.
