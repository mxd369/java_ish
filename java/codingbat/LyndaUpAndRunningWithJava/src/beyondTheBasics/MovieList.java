- Okay, it's time once again for our challenge.
This challenge is designed to reinforce the skills you
learned about classes and objects.
In this challenge, you'll want to create a movie class that
contains the following information:
the name of the movie,
the movie rating,
such as G for general audience,
PG for parental guidance,
PG-13, etc,
the year the movie was made, and the run time in minutes.
You'll need instance data for each piece of information I just mentioned.

The name of the movie, the rating, the year and the run time,
as well as a public interface. Remember, when creating classes,
it is helpful to provide accessor and mutator methods for each piece
of data mentioned above, but this is not required for this challenge.
You will need a constructor, though.
In your main program, you ask the user to enter the information
about their favorite movie, including the title, the rating,
the year and the run time, then create a movie object with the information.
Finally, print it out using a two String method similar to the examples from this section.

Okay, that's your challenge. I'm estimating 20 minutes for this activity,
but it might take a little longer if you're new to this process. Have fun!
