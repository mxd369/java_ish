The Dot Operator (.)

The dot operator (.) gives you access to an object's state and behavior (instance variables methods).

// make a new object Dog d = new Dog();
Dog d = new Dog();

// tell it to bark by using the
// dot operator on the
// variable d to call bark()
d.bark();

// set its size using the
// dot operator
d.size = 40;
