Project Overview

The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned from this course. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app, with an opportunity to publish it in the Google Play store.

The goal is to create an educational app that teaches 5 new things to a user on a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what these 5 things will be and how you want to present this to your user.

If you are subscribed to the paid version of this course, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the project rubric and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.

Why this project?

So far in this course, we’ve built three apps together: the Happy Birthday, Court Counter and Just Java apps. At this point, we believe that you’re now ready to create your own app. You will have full ownership over the creative vision, planning, and development of the app.

From what we’ve seen in the discussion forums, you each have a wealth of different experiences and unique areas of expertise. We would like to see that shine through in the app that you create.

What Will I Learn?

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Planning your app design before coding.
Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
Creating, positioning, and styling views.
Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
Commenting and documenting your code.
